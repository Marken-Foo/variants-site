# TheChessPolyglot #

Welcome to Illion's chesses site!

This site is dedicated to all kinds of chess types and variants: xiangqi, go, shogi, makruk, orthodox retrograde problems...

...with the very glaring exception of atomic chess, which you can find at [my other site](https://illion-atomic.netlify.app/).

Not much is on the site now except [the beginnings of a xiangqi book translation]({{< ref "/translations/xqsfcb/0-main.md" >}}).
