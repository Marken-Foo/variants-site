# TheChessPolyglot #

Welcome to Illion's chesses site!

This site is dedicated to all kinds of chess types and variants: xiangqi, go, shogi, makruk, orthodox retrograde problems...

...with the very glaring exception of atomic chess, which you can find at [my other site](https://illion-atomic.netlify.app/).

For the moment the site is not completely polished, but you can still navigate using the "Variants" or "Tags" categories.

Some of the highlights you may be here for are:

- [My series on shogi history]({{< ref "content/timeless/shogi-history/0.0-main.md" >}})
- A [translation of the Japanese tsumeshogi Wikipedia article]({{< ref "content/translations/tsumeshogi-wiki.md" >}}), with information on composers, rules, themes and more
- A [translated list of xiangqi proverbs]({{< ref "content/post/200511-xq-proverbs.md" >}})
