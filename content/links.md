Here is a set of links to good sites:

## Where to play? ##
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) - One of the largest sites for playing atomic chess (or regular chess and other variants) online. Completely free and open-source, and with good diagram, study and analysis tools.


## Who can I discuss with? ##
[The House Discord Server](https://dscrd.me/housechessvariants) - A Discord server for many chess variants, including atomic, crazyhouse, bughouse, antichess (losing chess), 4-player, Horde and much more. A lively community including many strong players in each variant, some of whom are even GMs and IMs in regular chess.
