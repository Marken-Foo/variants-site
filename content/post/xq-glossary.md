This is a glossary of xiangqi terms that I find useful for reference when reading or translating from Chinese. Some terms I adopt from [Jim Png's glossary](http://www.xqinenglish.com/glossary_of_xiangqi_terms.html), others I prefer to translate differently.

## Common terms ##
**Kill** （杀；杀棋）
: Checkmate. Can be a verb or noun. A literal translation, but a common and succinct one.

**Root** （根；生根）
: A rooted piece is one which has a defender; the defender is called the *root*. Conversely, an unrooted piece is an undefended piece. Also a verb, as in *rooting a piece*, to provide a piece with a defender.

**Full guard** （士象全）
: (To have) Both advisors and both elephants.


## Xiangqi tactics names ##
[Source article](http://www.360doc.com/content/12/0211/12/200521_185750756.shtml); but this is not a direct translation.

Xiangqi tactics are not all at the same "level"; there is an implied loose hierarchy of terms here, with simple elements like checks and double attacks forming the basis for more complex patterns like luring, and somewhat vague concepts like manoeuvring.

**Manipulating** （顿挫）
: A broad class of forcing methods. For example using moves like checks or threatening pieces to force the opponent to react a certain way, or perhaps to gain a tempo for your own purposes.

**Double attack** （捉双）
: Creating simultaneous threats on two pieces with a single move. This is the principal way to force a win of material. Note that the Chinese term refers specifically to attacking two pieces.

**Discovered attack** （闪击；挪）
: Moving one piece to open the line of another piece behind it, revealing a threat. Note that due to the pieces' movements, the possibilities in this category are much greater in xiangqi than in western chess. The piece that moves can often itself fulfil another useful purpose, sometimes creating two threats at once.

**Double threat** （双重威胁）
: Creating two threats with a single move. More general than the double attack, this can include theatening a piece and mate simultaneously, or creating two mate threats at once.

**Clearing** （腾挪）
: A clearing move is one which efficiently moves away a piece that is causing mobility problems. It can even be one which sacrifices said piece, as long as the ultimate effect is to increase the overall effectiveness of the other pieces.

**Attraction/Luring** （吸引）
: Bringing enemy pieces (or the king) to places where they can be easily attacked or where they obstruct their own forces, usually by means of an exchange or a sacrifice. This is a very important tactic to be aware of in mating attacks, much like in crazyhouse. The emphasis here is on the position the piece is attracted to, and so is distinct from "distraction".

**Distraction** （引离）
: Bringing enemy pieces away from key places, where they were perhaps guarding an important line or participating in a mating attack. This is usually achieved by exchanges or offering a sacrifice. The emphasis here is on the position the piece was distracted from, and so is distinct from "attraction".

**Flanking** （迂回）
: If the opponent's defence is strong from the front, direct your own forces to attack the side where the opponent's defences are weaker. This concept originates from Sun Zi's *The Art of War*, Chapter VI: “夫兵形象水，水之行，避高而趋下；兵之形，避实而击虚。水因地而制流，兵因敌而制胜。故兵无常势，水无常形，能因敌变化而取胜者，谓之神。故五行无常胜，四时无常位，日有短长，月有死生。”

**Exchanging** （兑子）
: The simple act of trading pieces of equal value is given much more focus in xiangqi than in western chess. There are many subtleties not often noted in western chess manuals. To name a few: An exchange can cause one side to have better/worse piece positioning after the trade (since in a simple capture-recapture, the recapturer must move). An exchange can result in gain or loss of initiative. An exchange can change the balance of force deployment on the board, resulting in one or both sides becoming overconcentrated on one side or the other. An exchange can change the implications for king safety or endgame possibilities, depending on the defensive pieces left for both sides.

**Blockade** （封锁）
: Broadly speaking, the act of restricting one or more enemy pieces so that they lose effectiveness. This effectively results in a force advantage over the rest of the board.

**Sacrifice** （弃子）
: Giving up material to achieve some other goal, for example to break through defensive lines, get the initiative, attract enemy pieces to vulnerable locations, or for mating attacks. This usually must be backed up with precise calculation, otherwise the desired outcome fails to manifest and one is simply left with less material. Sacrificing is a skill that is a double-edged sword, but one that is absolutely essential for improvement.

**Temporary sacrifice** （先弃后取）
: A temporary sacrifice is one where the opponent is obliged to return the sacrificed material at a later stage to avoid even worse losses. Being able to discern and utilise temporary sacrifices requires imagination and skill, and is a mark of a good xiangqi player.

**Interference** （隔断）
: Moving a piece to interrupt the link between an enemy piece and its defender (its root), resulting in the enemy piece becoming undefended.

**Borrowing power** （借力）
: Borrowing a friendly piece's power to increase the effectiveness of moving a different friendly piece, for instance moving the second piece to a point defended by the first one, or by having the second piece move to reveal discovered attack by the first one, with tempo.

**Manoeuvring** （运子）
: Manoeuvring is about moving pieces to effective locations. In xiangqi, piece activity and coordination is of fundamental importance, and making sure your pieces work harmoniously for attack and defence is a key skill.

**Trapping** （困子）
: Surrounding and restricting an enemy piece such that it cannot move or loses its potential. A piece does not actually have to be captured in order for the trapping to be considered a success.

**Blocking** （拦截）
: Hindering an enemy piece's mobility by directly putting a piece in its path, or luring an enemy piece there.

**Pinning** （牵制）
: Using one piece to put two (or more!) enemy pieces in a situation such that if one moves, the other, previously unattacked, falls under attack. This can be used to restrict the movement of enemy pieces, especially if the second piece is the king (an absolute pin). Note that in xiangqi, the cannon can pin two pieces at once to a third, the horse and elephant also can pin by virtue of their movements, and even the king can pin a piece to the enemy king.

**Counter-killing** （解杀还杀）
: Meeting a checkmate threat with a move that simultaneously defends the threat and creates a mate threat on the enemy king. Arguably the strongest possible counterattack (and not an infrequent occurrence).
