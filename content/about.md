This is Illion from Singapore. o/

I play many chess types and variants. First and foremost, I'm trained as a western chess player. Playing and learning since I was 6, I've participated on and off in tournaments, never quite making it to a good level, but also never quite able to quit the addiction. I feebly maintain a 2000 blitz rating at [lichess](https://lichess.org). 

In the second instance, I'm also a mostly self-taught xiangqi player, starting admirably with a streak of 30 losses against a friend when I was 14. Since then I've also participated in school tournaments with several team tournament wins, and generally been a better-than-complete-beginner at it. I hover around 1200 at [PlayOK](https://playok.com).

My main variant, so to speak, is atomic chess, hovering consistently around 2300 on lichess which is probably two tiers below the best players. I am (very probably) also the player the most *obsessed* with researching fundamental endgame knowledge. My [first site](https://illion-atomic.netlify.app/) is entirely focused on atomic chess.

Outside the competitive side of chess, I'm also an on-and-off problemist/solver, specialising in retrograde analysis and proof games. I've composed a number of lightweight retros and PGs, not heavy on the themes but sometimes tricky, sometimes entertaining.
