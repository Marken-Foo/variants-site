I am Illion from Singapore.

At the core of it, I'm trained as a western chess player. I've been playing since age 6, played in school tournaments with decent results, and never really forgot the lessons nor quit the chess scene. I maintain a 2000 blitz rating at [lichess](https://lichess.org), but without seriously trying to improve any more.

I'm also a mostly self-taught xiangqi player, starting with a streak of 30 losses against a friend when I was about 14. Since then I also participated in school tournaments with several team tournament wins, and consider myself an amateur of middling strength.

Currently I'm also known as a strong amateur of atomic chess, hovering consistently around 2300 on lichess again, and probably the player the most obsessed with fundamental endgame knowledge. Some of my lichess studies are literally the endgame theory for those material balances. My [first site](https://illion-atomic.netlify.app/) is entirely focused on atomic chess.

Outside the competitive side of chess, I'm also an on-and-off problemist/solver, specialising in retrograde analysis and proof games. I've composed a number of small little retros and PGs, more for lightweight entertainment value than actual demonstration of themes.

Recently I've also taken an interest in go, shogi and makruk. It helps that I can read Japanese and Chinese (but unfortunately not Thai or Cambodian).
