Introduction to xiangqi mating techniques 1.1

In the diagram, the red pawn's position is excellent, and the elephant in the middle allows the red king to freely move left and right. Red can win.

{{< fen-diag variant="xiangqi" fen="4ka3/9/9/4P4/9/9/9/4B4/9/3K5 w - -0 1" >}}

**1. P5+1**

The pawn charges down the middle file, from where it can later control the important rib files according to the situation.

**1...A6+5 2. K6=5**

The central king prepares to support the pawn at any time, which will control the black king. This is the key to victory.

**2...A5-4 3. P5=4!**

The red pawn moves to the rib file opposite from the advisor.

**3...K5=6**

If instead 3...K5+1, then 4. K5=6 K5-1 5. P4+1 A4+5 6. E5-3 A5+4 7. K6+1 K5-4 (7...A4-5 8. K6=5, red still wins) 8. P4=5, red wins. Alternatively, if 3...A4+5, then 4. P4+1 A5+6 5. K5=6 A6-5 7. E5-3 with the same winning method.

**4. K5=4**

Red's centralised king can now support the pawn from behind to control the black king.

**4...A4+5 5. P4+1 K6=5 6. K4=5 A5-6 7. K5=6**

The red king gets to the 6th file one step faster, forming a sandwich with the red pawn. Victory is at hand.

**7...A6+5 8. E5-3 A5+4 9. K6+1**

Advancing the king is a waiting move putting black in zugzwang.

**9...A4-5 10. K6=5**

Trapping the black advisor. Red wins.
