In real matches, single-piece-type endgames are more or less synonymous with "practical" endgames. When players face this type of endgame, they typically have to follow certain practical endgame principles to win. Therefore, this chapter aims to introduce some endgames that appear in practice and also have a certain element of difficulty in the winning techniques, so that when the reader encounters such endings in their own games, they will be able to sieze the opportunity and clinch a smooth victory.

{{< remark >}}Remark: The contents of this chapter, while very useful, are not exhaustive in the endgame knowledge that one should have. It may be useful to look at other resources, such as the [endgame material from XQ in English](http://www.xqinenglish.com/endgames.html).{{< /remark >}}
