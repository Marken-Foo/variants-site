# Tsumeshogi #

Tsumeshogi is a type of puzzle using shogi rules.

From a starting position, consecutive checks are made to deliver mate to the opponent's king. Originating as practice problems to train endgame skill for practical play, now tsumeshogi as a puzzle has become a distinct field in its own right.


## Overview ##

Because the objective is the same as in practical play (to mate the king), realistic tsumeshogi problems are typically thought to be a useful way to develop endgame skill in shogi. As tsumeshogi evolved to become a unique product in and of itself, as former Meijin Masuda Kouzou described it, "the charm of tsumeshogi is all in its unexpected vibrancy". Differing from standard wisdom and valuation systems, the sacrifices, the supposedly inferior non-promoting moves, the drops with limited scope and yet other surprising tactics and ideas abound, and a new joy of solving or creating these problems emerges.

The shortest problems are 1te, followed by 3te, 5te, 7te and so on, all having an odd number of moves. This is because the problem begins with sente (semekata) making the first move, and ends with sente delivering mate. The relatively easier problems of up to about 19 moves are found in newspapers, on television or in shogi magazines, while the comparatively harder to solve and longer works are found in collections published as books or in specialist tsumeshogi magazines. A representative specialist magazine is Tsumeshogi Paradise, while shogi magazines such as Shogi Sekai (Shogi World) and Kindai Shogi (Recent in Shogi) also carry regular shogi columns. Problems judged as outstanding are conferred awards; Tsumeshogi Paradise awards the Kanju Prize, and Kindai Shogi awards the Tsukada Prize.

Well-known modern tsumeshogi composers include Kurokawa Ichirou 黒川一郎, Shichijou Kenzou 七條兼三, Komaba Kazuo 駒場和男, Ootsuka Toshio 大塚敏男, Yamada Shuuji 山田修司, Kitahara Yoshiharu 北原義治, Kashiwagawa Etsuo, 柏川悦夫, Okada Satoshi 岡田敏, Sakai Katsuhiko 酒井克彦, Tanaka Itaru 田中至, Ueda Yoshikazu 上田吉一, Wakashima Tadashi 若島正, Yamamoto Shouichi 山本昭一, Yamazaki Takashi 山崎隆, Morinaga Hiroaki 森長宏明, Yanagita Akira 柳田明, Itou Tadashi 伊藤正, Fujimoto Kazu 藤本和, Soekawa Kouji 添川公司, Hashimoto Kouji 橋本孝治, Souma Yasuyuki 相馬康幸, Tajima Hideo 田島秀男, Kuwabara Tatsuo 桑原辰雄.

In addition, many shogi professionals also compose tsumeshogi, with their published works usually having been produced as part of endgame and practical training. However, few of them create thematic works like the aforementioned specialist composers. Notable tsumeshogi composers among professionals (including retired and deceased) are first and foremost Tsukada Masao Lifetime 9-dan/honorary 10-dan and Futakami Tatsuya 9-dan; also famous are Naitou Kunio 9-dan, Tanigawa Kouji 9-dan, Itou Hatasu 8-dan (formerly Itou Yoshikazu), and Nakada Shoudou 7-dan. Other professionals who have composed are Harada Yasuo 9-dan, Takayanagi Toshio honorary 9-dan, Seino Shizuo 8-dan, Igarashi Toyoichi 9-dan, Kumagai Michihito 9-dan, Kitamura Masao 9-dan, Maruta Yuuzou 9-dan, Katsuura Osamu 9-dan, Katou Hifumi 9-dan, Katou Hiroji 9-dan, Satou Shouhei 8-dan, Satou Daigorou 9-dan, Oouchi Nobuyuki 9-dan, Kiriyama Kiyozumi 9-dan, Sekine Shigeru 9-dan, Nakahara Makoto 16th Meijin/Lifetime 10-dan, Kisei, Oui and Ouza, Kobayashi Kenji 9-dan, Takahashi Michio 9-dan, Urano Masahiko 8-dan, Mori Nobuo 7-dan, Kitahama Kensuke 8-dan, Satou Yasumitsu 9-dan, Miura Hiroyuki 9-dan, Funae Kouhei 6-dan, Saitou Shintarou 8-dan, Fujii Souta 7-dan, etc. Previously, Shogi Sekai published collections of tsumeshogi problems composed by all professional players. In addition, some problems are published in newspapers and magazines, and even sometimes composed at an occasion in place of giving an autograph. Among female professional players, Hayamizu Chisa ladies 3-dan and others are noted to compose tsumeshogi.

Since 2011, tsumeshogi books of 5te and shorter problems have been published to cater to the beginner and casual audiences.

Similar puzzles exist in western chess, known as chess problems. However, in these it is preferred not to have a solution consisting of consecutive checks.


## Rules ##

The side delivering mate is referred to as semekata 攻方, "attacker" (or tsumekata 詰方), while the side that gets mated is gyokukata 玉方, "king side" (or ukekata 受方).

- Semekata plays first.
- Semekata must deliver mate with consecutive checks.
- Semekata can drop pieces in hand, as well as pieces they capture in the course of play.
- Gyokukata plays the best moves to prolong mate as much as possible.
- Where gyokukata has multiple moves leading to variations of the same length, the correct one is the one which makes sente use a piece in hand. In addition, gyokukata will prefer to interpose a check with a piece on the board over dropping a piece from the hand (aigoma 合駒), given that both options lead to mate in the same length.
- Gyokukata has in hand "all other pieces", in other words all pieces not on the board or in semekata's hand, excepting the other king.
    - Gyokukata can use these hand pieces as aigoma to interpose checks.
    - If all pieces of a type are already accounted for on the board and in semekata's hand, gyokukata cannot drop such a piece. For instance, if there are two dragons on the board, gyokukata cannot drop a rook from their hand as aigoma.
    - Gyokukata dropping interposing pieces which are met by simply capturing them without fundamentally changing the mating variations are termed "futile interpositions" and are not considered in the move count. However, if the aigoma can let gyokukata escape mate, or if the mating variations differ with and without the drop, then it is not considered futile. Certain problems may end with the final move being a check that can only be met by interpositions which can be captured for immediate mate, even if not by the checking piece; these interpositions are also considered futile.
- Aside from the above, all rules of normal shogi are in force (notably, pieces cannot be dropped in places where they have no future legal moves, nifu is not allowed, and semekata cannot mate with a pawn drop (uchifu-dzume) or do perpetual check sennichite.)

There are also restrictions on the composer as to what constitutes a valid problem:

- There must be a single unique intended line of play.
    - An alternate line other than the composer's intention but also leading to mate are termed yo-dzume 余詰 (in western chess parlance, "cooks"), and can be considered to be flaws in the composition.
- At the end of the intended line of play, semekata should have no pieces left in hand. (Having extra pieces in hand, komayori 駒余り is not allowed.)
- The board should not have pieces that are unnecessary and do not participate in the mate. However, "practical" or "realistic" 実戦型 tsumeshogi will usually feature pieces to resemble formations often seen in games.

## History ##

Tsumeshogi was first conceived in the beginning of the Edo period. If, as game historian Masukawa Kouichi points out, the "compositions" found in the Shingen Yuugaku Orai 新撰遊覚往来 are considered as tsumeshogi, then tsumeshogi can be considered to have existed as early as the 15th century AD.

The oldest tsumeshogi on record are published in the manual Shougi Zoubutsu 象戯造物 by Oohashi Soukei I 初代大橋宗桂 (1555-1634), in the Keichou years (1596-1615). This was intended to teach thinking in the endgame phase, and lacked the modern requirements to mate in the shortest number of moves and have no pieces in semekata's hand at the end.

After Soukei, it became customary for the sitting Meijin to present the shogunate with a collection of tsumeshogi problems, known as kenjou-zushiki 献上図式, leading to the development of tsumeshogi. The works offered by Oohashi Soukan III in 1734 (『将棋作物』, also called 『将棋無双』 or 『詰むや詰まざるや』) and his brother Itou Kanju in 1755 (『将棋図式』, also called 『将棋図巧』) are considered to be the pinnacle of tsumeshogi in the Edo period. It was Itou Soukan who codified the rules of tsumeshogi then. Itou Kanju's legacy remains today in the award named after him, the Kanju Prize.

Starting from the 9th Meijin Oohashi Souei VI, the presentation of tsumeshogi to the shogunate was no longer held, and development of tsumeshogi stagnated for a time. Its revival came in the Showa era, when Shogi Geppou 将棋月報 (Shogi Monthly) started serialising tsumeshogi problems. Since then the development of tsumeshogi took an independent turn from the practical game, leading compositions of great complexity or high artistic value. As of May 2019, the longest tsumeshogi problem published was Hashimoto Kouji's 1525te *Microcosmos* (1986/6, Tsumeshogi Paradise; versions after).

Contrasting with the specialised, artistic side of the field, a different direction of tsumeshogi development emphasised its indispensable role in practical endgame training, and thereafter resulted in its popularisation. Not long after the Second World War, in a great boost to tsumeshogi, the 2nd Meijin titleholder Tsukada Masao published many shogi books aimed at ordinary players. From Tsukada's attribution of his endgame skill development to tsumeshogi, the concept of practical tsumeshogi problems was born. The simple idea of endgame training = tsumeshogi led to a huge rise in popularity of the tsumeshogi subgenre of books among shogi enthusiasts.

In the 2000s, more tsumeshogi books featuring much shorter problems and organised by number of moves became popular, like Urano Masahiko's highly-praised "Handbook" series, bringing tsumeshogi to the masses as not just an endgame training method but as a brain training puzzle, expanding its popularity beyond just shogi players.

Furthermore, tsumeshogi columns appear in media typically bought by salarymen like sports newspapers, weekly magazines and broadsheets. These are also seen as a good way to while the time away in the train or waiting in hair salons.

## Kanju Prize and Tsukada Prize ##

These are prizes awarded to recognise outstanding tsumeshogi problems.

### Kanju Prize ###

The Kanju Prize was established by the Japanese Tsumeshogi Association (全日本詰将棋連盟, or 全詰連 for short) and is announced in the publication "Tsumeshogi Paradise". The first Kanju Prize was awarded in 1950, but there followed a gap of 11 years before the second Kanju Prize was awarded in 1960. Since then, the prize has been awarded every year. It is the most prestigious prize that can be awarded for tsumeshogi. There are three main categories of short (17te and shorter), medium (19te to 49te) and long (51te and above), as well as a special category to recognise particularly noteworthy problems.

The prize is named after the foremost among tsumeshogi composers in the Edo period, the shogi player Itou Kanju.

Modern professionals have also been awarded the Kanju Prize; Urano Masahiko won in the short category in 1983 and in the special category in 1995, Tanigawa Kouji the special category in 1997, and Naitou Kunio the special category in 1998. Since 2004, Urano Masahiko has also been on the judging panel.

Also, the 2004 medium category was won by the then-Shoreikai 2-dan Funae Kouhei (who subsequently became a 4-dan professional in 2010.)

Eligible for the award each year are all problems published in newspapers and magazines in that year, except for from 1988 to 1990 where only problems published in Tsumeshogi Paradise were eligible. Problems published outside of shogi-related media can also be considered for the prize, like the 1987 short category winner (published in the Hochi Shimbun, now Sports Hochi) and the 1998 special category winner (published in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, now The Nikkei).

Now, problems published on the internet can also be eligible for the prize if they meet certain conditions. Like with print media, they do not necessarily have to appear on shogi-related websites to be eligible.

### Tsukada Prize ###

The Tsukada Prize was awarded by Kindai Shogi (ceased publication in June 2008) and announced in their issues. It was named after the 2nd Meijin titleholder Tsukada Masao. Until his death in 1977, he judged the award. There were three categories of short (under 20te), medium (under 40te) and long (41te and longer) awarded each year.

## Kadowaki Yoshio Prize ##

The Kadowaki Yoshio Prize was established by the Japanese Tsumeshogi Association, and is announced in Tsumeshogi Paradise. It recognises individuals who have contributed to the development of the field of tsumeshogi.

When Kadowaki Yoshio was hospitalised, the Japanese Tsumeshogi Association raised funds for him, but he refused the money, instead donating all of it back to the association. Thus the Kadowaki Yoshio Prize was established.

## Tsumeshogi terms ##

As explained above, tsumeshogi development took its own turn away from the practical game. As such, it gained a specialised vocabulary with its own unique terms.

### Length ###

Following the system of the Kanju Prize:

**Short**
: Problems of up to 17te. Problems up to 5te are also classified as very short problems. Most tsumeshogi books on the market are of this sort, particularly "single-digit problems" of 9te or fewer.

**Medium**
: Problems between 19te and 49te inclusive.

**Long**
: Problems of 51te and longer.

The exact definitions of these categories may vary from person to person.

### Varieties of tsumeshogi ###

**Kyoku-dzume （曲詰） and aburidashi （あぶりだし）**
: Problems where the arrangement of the pieces on the board draws out a shape or a character. Those where the shape or character appear as the initial diagram are called kyoku-dzume, while those where they appear as the final mating position are called aburidashi (named for a form of invisible ink writing). The name aburidashi comes from 1937, when 18-year-old prodigy Watanabe Susumu composed three problems spelling 「カ」「ミ」「風」 (to commemorate the flight of the 神風号 from Tokyo to London), and Katou Jirou (honorary 9-dan) named the tsumeshogi technique. There are also tsumeshogi problems where the board arrangement occurs in the middle of the solution. Problems where both initial and final positions form shapes or characters are called rittai-kyokudzume. Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu's composition 「七の字詰め」 is a famous example. Kyoku-dzume are also composed to celebrate an event, especially for shogi players or tsumeshogi composers.

**Sougyoku tsumeshogi （双玉詰将棋）**
: Problems where semekata also has a king, hence two kings are on the board (sougyoku = two kings). Like in actual shogi, semekata must respond when gyokukata delivers a check. Although Katou Geno's compositions just after World War II heralded the start of an age of sougyoku problems, the first issue of the "Shogi Sekai" monthly (October 1937) featured sougyoku problems, and it is unclear when the first actual publication of such a problem was. A notable sougyoku composer today is professional 7-dan Kanki Hiromitsu, with many published problems to his name.

**Daidou tsumeshogi / Daidougi （大道詰将棋・大道棋）**
: These were originally tsumeshogi at roadside stores for customers to attempt to solve for a prize. These problems would seem to be simple at first glance, but an unexpected defence by gyokukata would create difficulties, often requiring a dan-level of ability to solve. Such problems are now generally referred to as daidou tsumeshogi. A large number of them are sougyoku problems. For a majority of the problems, the author is also unknown. Fans of these problems at roadside stores and other places recorded them, and there seem to have been around 3000 problems, of which close to 500 remain today. Many daidougi come from the end of the Taishou era, recorded by Oda Keiho, a strong amateur player (6-dan) who invented the Onigoroshi opening. Besides him, when Masuda Kouzou left home, for a period he lived off the money he made solving daidougi. Today, daidougi are mostly found only in bazaars and such places.

**Lance-pawn problems / Gold problems / Silver problems （香歩問題・金問題・銀問題）**
: These types of problems have all regularly appeared as daidougi. There are a number of series of daidougi with identical starting positions, differing only in the pieces in hand, hence the name of these types of problems.

**Kemuri-dzume （煙詰）**
: Problems where the initial position has all 39 pieces on the board (except semekata's king), and the final position has the minimum number of pieces needed for mate (3 pieces). The 99th problem in Itou Kanju's 『将棋図巧』 collection is the first kemuri-dzume composed. Note that for the king to be mated not at the edge of the board, 4 pieces must remain (including the king); this was originally the subject of debate, but today is accepted as a type of kemuri-dzume.


#### Classification by initial position ####

**Mushikake （無仕掛け）**
: Tsumeshogi where semekata has no pieces on the boad in the initial position.

**Muboubi zushiki （無防備図式）**
: Tsumeshogi where gyokukata has no pieces other than the king on the board in the initial position.
